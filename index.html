					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>
					<p> When I was a kid, I was interested in becoming an astrophysicist. I remember reading so many astronomy related books with illustrations of black holes and massive red stars. In high school, I gravitated towards reading as many books from Physicists and Mathematicians such as Michio Kaku, Stephen Hawking, Paul Dirac, Richard Feynman, Lawrence Krauss, Roger Penrose, and others. After graduating high school, I enlisted in the USAF and served for six years. For the first four years, I was an avionics technician specializing in Electronic Warfare and Computer Systems. For the remaining two years, I was assigned special duty as a Maintenance Operations Center Controller, controlling operations pertaining to maintenance of multiple aircrafts.</p>
					<p> Once my enlistment ended, I moved to Salt Lake City, Utah to pursue a B.S. in Physics. My passion for physics carried me through my education at Westminster College. Here I found a new interest in coding after being exposed to programming languages such as Python, R, SAS, MATLAB, and Mathematica. After graduating, I decided to pursue a graduate degree in data science from Maryville University in St. Louis, MO. Before and during my degree, I would research and study topics of machine learning and deep learning. Recently, I graduated from Maryville University, and I am continuing to research and expand my knowledge in data science related topics. Below in the portfolio section, you can find some of the projects I have been working on since graduation.</p>

								<h4><a href="https://github.com/Samuel-DiMaggio/SDS-Prescreen-Tool">Regulatory Chemical Prescreen Tool</a></h4>
								<p>This tool utilizes tokenization from the NLP library to search through a given Safety Data Sheet to identify chemicals of interest that pertain to Federal and International regulatory requirements. Containing a simple GUI input and output for a easy user experience. This link demonstrates how to convert this python file to a executable file using Nuitka.</p>

								<h4><a href="https://github.com/Samuel-DiMaggio/ML_Star_Classification">Multiclass Classification Using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Algorithms </a></h4>
								<p>The purpose for this project is to use machine learning techniques, such as logistical regression, support vector machine, and random forest algorithms to predict multiple classes for a set of data. For this project, in particular, will focus on a dataset set of 240 stars to predict classes of star based on features provided by the dataset and evaluate which technique works best for these predictions.</p>

								<h4><a href="https://github.com/Samuel-DiMaggio/DL_Book_Recommendations">Simple Book Recommender Using Deep Learning</a></h4>
								<p>Here I created a simple book recommender system using tensorflow to identify possible books a user may enjoy based off a rating system from 1 to 10. I had the program to randomly select a user and recommend a list of 10 books that the user might enjoy.</p>
